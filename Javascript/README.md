## I've always neglected studying javascript because it involves a lot of front-end development. However, I do actually enjoy the freedom you have when developing in Javascript. The possibilities are endless.

### Here's a list of things I've learned from studying Javascript:

* Creating elements
* The HTML hierarchy and children system
* Appending
* Functions
* Manipulating elements 

#### While I still strongly prefer LuaU, Python and C#, I do enjoy these Javascript classes quite a lot.
